# Tell It by Myself...

The Central Equation of [Solow Model](Solow%20Model.md) is:

$$
\Delta k = sf(k)-\delta k
$$
It determines the behaviors of capital over time => determines behavior of all the other endogenous variables because they all depend on $k$ .

When $sy=sk^\alpha = \delta k$ , which means $\Delta k= 0$, that means the *investment is just enough to cover the depreciation*. The [[Steady State]] occur.

We use $k^ {*}$ to represents the [Steady State](Steady%20State) situation.

Then we can move to the method called [[Golden Rule]]

The technological progress is assumed *exogenous* (i.e. the value of $g$ is given)

That means: 

$$
\frac {\Delta E}{E}=g
$$
