## Lecture 1 Review on [[ECON2003 Intermediate Microeconomics II]]

[[Cournot Equilibrium]]

An equilibrium can be in 2 steps:

Step 1: Derive the **Best Response**, we set the $q_2$ unchanged, and find out how firm 1 react to maximize its profit. ($q_1$) , that is $u(q_1,q_2):=(1-q_1-q_2)q_1-cq_1$ , *$c$ stands for cost.*

Usually, $q_1=\frac{1-q_2-c}{2}$ is the best response to $q_2$

### Another case: The [[Cournot Equilibrium]] under [[Monopoly]] case.

The key trade off is: *More sales* vs. *lower price*

Since the Monopoly price is quite high, so the firms are all willing to sell more.

Call back to the [[Perfect Competition]], $p=MC=c$ , that means, $(q^C,p^C,u^C)=(1-c,c,0)$ 

---

And the result would be,

$q^M < q^ ∗ < q^C$

$p^C < p^∗ < p^M$

$u^C < u^∗ < u^M$

---

However, for the *social welfare*, the [[Perfect Competition]] performs best.

[[Merger]] is good for the firms.

### Bertrand Competition

How about the firms compete in price? 

In [[Bertrand Model]], $(p_1,p_2)=(c,c)$ is the [[Nash Equilibrium]] the firm's profit is zero in the equilibrium. Similar to [[Perfect Competition]]

Since the product are the same (the assumption is so), the firms all have incentive to increase the market share from $50\%$ to $100\%$. 

Introducing the *product differentiation* would solve this problem.

## The [[Cournot Equilibrium]] vs. [[Bertrand Model]]

This was also mentioned in [[ECON2003 总复习#^210420]] 

Then consider a stylized [[Hotelling Model]]

# [[Dynamic Games]]

Usually we use the *backward induction* to solve the problem. And the solution is called the [[Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium]]. 

Example of the Entry Model.

## The Centipede Game

How about the [[Centipede Game]]?

As learned before, the unique equilibrium outcome would be the player one to choose $D$ at the first move, and the whole game ends.

## The bargain problem

#### Approach to analyze the Legal Rules:

- Step 1: What happens in the efficient outcome? (This does not depend on the allocation of the legal rights.) 
- Step 2: What happens without bargaining (threat values.) 
- Step 3: What is the [[Cooperative Surplus]]? 
- Step 4: What are the final payoffs after bargaining? *Given equal bargaining power, each party is better off by half of the cooperative surplus.**
- Step 5: Work out the corresponding price/transfer.
