It means **expenses incurred when buying or selling a good or service**

The potential [[Transaction Cost]] for [[Bargaining]] may be 

- Search cost (Before [[Bargaining]]) , if you are just playing [[Game Theory]] with your roommate, it has a relatively low Search Cost.
- Bargaining cost (during [[Bargaining]]), it includes the [[Asymmetric Information]], [[Free-Rider]] problem, and Hold-out problem (many sellers sharing the sale)
- Enforcement cost (after [[Bargaining]])

## High or Low

When [[Transaction Cost]] is low, that leads to facilitate voluntary trade, often related to [[Private Goods]].

When [[Transaction Cost]] is high, that leads to allocate rights efficiently, often related to [[Public Goods]]

In [[ECON4008 Law and Economics]], we measure the cost *mostly* consider how many people in the people.
