# Question 1
In a competitive labor market, shirking on the job can be a problem. In this market for labor services, the demand for labor is expressed as:

$$
W_d = \frac{270,000,000}{L^{1.5}}
$$
Where $W$ is wage rate (dollars per hour) and $L$ is number of employed per unit of time. The no-shirking constraint is expressed as:

$$
NSC = \frac{L^2}{1\times10^9}
$$
Where $NSC$ is the minimum wage workers need not to shirk, and $L$ is the employment rate. Assume that the labor force $L^{ * } = 150,000$. Determine the following:

1. The level of unemployment that would result when firms pay the efficiency wage.
2. The market clearing wage.
3. The efficiency wage.

# Answer
## 1

Since it is the efficiency wage rate, so that $NSC = W_d$, that is,

$$
\frac{L^2}{10^9} = \frac{27\times 10^7}{L^{1.5}}
$$

After calculation, $L_e = 95585$, then we use the existing labor force to subtract it: $L^{ * } - L^e = 54415$, which is also the [[Involuntary Unemployment]].

## 2

When market clearing, it is that all labor force participate in the work. That is 

$$
w_d= \frac{27\times 10^7}{(150,000)^{1.5}} = 4.648
$$

## 3

$$
w_e= \frac{27\times 10^7}{(95585)^{1.5}} = 9.14 >>w^{ * }
$$

# Question 2

Consider the following explanation of why wages can be above the competitive equilibrium prediction, as suggested by Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984). Assume a risk neutral worker with utility $u(w,e)=w-e$, where effort $e$ is binary $e=\{0,1\}$. The firm obtains a product $\alpha m$, where $\alpha > 0$ and where $m$ represents the number of workers choosing an effort $e= 1$. The firm can monitor only one worker, each with equal probability, paying each worker salary $w$ if he exerts a positive effort $e=1$, but zero otherwise. There are $n>2$ workers in the firm.

1. For a given salary $w$, under which conditions does each worker choose effort $e=1$?
2. Set up the firm's profit maximization problem, find the profit-maximizing salary $w$ and the number of workers $n$ hired.
3. If monitoring was perfect, how do your results in Q 1 and Q 2 change?
