# QUESTION 2   (14 points)

Consider the following cobweb model of labor market: $L_t^s = -10+0.9W_{t-1}$, and $L_t^d=100-0.6W_t$ 

1. Derive the general formula of $W_t$. (6 points)
2. Is it a stable model? Use a diagram to justify your answer. (8 points)

## Answer

1.  For general model, $-10+0.9W_{t-1}=100-0.6W_t$ , $W_t=\frac{1000-9W_{t-1}}{6}=\frac{550}{3}-\frac{3}{2}W_{t-1}$, so $a=\frac{550}{3}$, $b=\frac{3}{2}$. 
2. Since we don't know $W_0$,
$y_t=[y_0-{\frac{a}{1-b}}]b^t+\frac{a}{1-b}$  is the LR wage rate (General Equation)

$W_t= [W_0-\frac{220}{3}](-1.5) ^t+\frac{220}{3}$ , so $|b|>1$, it is unstable.

From the given, $W^{ * }= 73.3$, in the model, we assume $W_0 = 75$.
