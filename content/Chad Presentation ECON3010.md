 [[Poverty of Chad]]

## Content

Today, we will discuss Chad's progress against poverty and sustainable development. We will focus on the reasons why Chad is poor and what the people of Chad, particularly the government, have done to address these problems over the years.

During the research ,we are always trying to find out which aspect is special of Chad among other countries

One of the main issues contributing to Chad's poverty, which sets it apart from other developing countries, is its heavy dependence on oil. Chad's economic situation is strongly tied to oil prices, which are known to be volatile. For example, oil prices reached $79 per barrel in 2010 but dropped to a low of $17.02 in 1995. This instability can be detrimental to a country like Chad, which relies heavily on oil revenues.

Fortunately, from 2003 to 2019, Chad experienced a decline in poverty rates, thanks to the government's efforts and support from international aid and NGOs. The National Development Plan has played a crucial role in guiding poverty reduction strategies, with three versions published in 2003, 2005, and 2013.

Despite progress, challenges persist in reducing poverty due to high unemployment rates, low education levels, and regional disparities in development. Climate change and insecurity exacerbate poverty, particularly in rural areas where communities depend on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods.

However, we could see that after leading the world average line, we can see the Chad situation doesn't seem to be very significant, that means, we still have a long way to go.

Now, let's discuss the progress made toward sustainable development. Some of the critical challenges faced by Chad include limited access to clean energy, water scarcity and poor sanitation, and weak governance and corruption. You maybe think that the as a poor country like Chad, may not be able to handle these problems, however, they really made efforts. After tough research , the published paper I like most is ,In 2017, the Chad government released "Vision 2030, The Chad We Want," focusing on economic diversification, social development, and governance reform to guide the country's development over the next 13 years. The appendix of this document outlines the government's goals and strategies, which are quite impressive.

In conclusion, Chad has made progress in poverty reduction and sustainable development but still faces significant challenges. Continued efforts from the government, international organizations, and NGOs are essential to addressing these issues and fostering long-term development.

Now, I'd like to pass the mic to my teammate Sandy, who will discuss the role of the government in Chad's development further.
