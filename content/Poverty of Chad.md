*简单介绍背景*

According to the World Bank, Chad has made some progress against poverty over the years, but the country still faces significant challenges. The poverty rate in Chad was estimated to be 61.3% in 2018, a slight decline from the 65% rate in 2012. 
*介绍贫困的原因*
The causes of poverty in Chad can be categorized into several areas: health conditions, access to education, and poor geography.
Its location in the heart of the Sahara desert in West Africa, its distance from the ocean, its arid land, harsh climate, and lack of irrigation for agriculture have limited Chad's economic development due to its low food production. In addition, Chad's largest lake has diminished by 90% in the past 50 years. This also affect the fish industry.
The lack of education also has a huge impact on the poverty of Chad. Only half of the children go to school, it also leads to the decrease of income.
A single source of income is also the main reason. Chad's economic situation, as an oil-exporting country, is very much affected by oil price fluctuations.*（在这里感觉可以补充一下国际最近二十年的石油走势）*
*接下来是讲政府做的努力*
According to the world bank, the national poverty rate has declined from 55% to 47% between 2003 and 2011.
Although Chad remains one of the poorest countries in the world and is among the worst performing countries in the world in terms of social and economic development. The government of Chad has taken several measures to reduce poverty and address other development challenges. These include introducing tax reforms, increasing public spending on social services, and improving access to finance. The government has also initiated several large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the expansion of the Chad Railway, in an effort to stimulate economic growth and development.
The effects of these policies have been mixed. While there has been some progress in reducing poverty, the country is still far from meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals. There is also evidence to suggest that the most vulnerable populations, such as rural women, are the least likely to benefit from the government's efforts.
Overall, Chad has made some progress against poverty, but much more needs to be done to ensure that these gains are sustained and that the most vulnerable populations benefit from the government's efforts.

Chad has made modest progress against poverty but continues to face considerable challenges. According to World Bank estimates, Chad’s poverty rate declined slightly from 65% in 2012 to 61.3% in 2018. However, most Chadians still live in extreme poverty, subsisting on less than $1.90 per day. This essay examines the determinants of poverty in Chad and evaluates the government’s efforts to promote development.

Chad’s geography severely constrains economic activity. Located in the Sahara, Chad lacks access to oceans and suffers from desert climate, arid soil, and paucity of arable land, limiting agricultural production and trade. Lake Chad has shrunk 90% in 50 years, damaging fishing. These environmental constraints have obstructed economic diversification and growth. 

Lack of education also contributes to poverty. Only about half of Chadian children receive education, leading to lower income and productivity. Reliance on volatile oil exports makes Chad’s economy vulnerable to price shocks. From 2000 to 2020, oil price fluctuations caused major GDP growth changes, with economic volatility worsening poverty. 

Poor governance and political issues exacerbate poverty. Chad ranks 165th of 198 countries in corruption. Communal conflicts and terrorism divert resources from development. Unequal distribution of resources across religious and ethnic groups hinders inclusive growth.  

To address poverty, Chad increased social spending, reformed taxes, and expanded infrastructure. Poverty rates fell from 55% in 2003 to 47% in 2011. However, gains disproportionately benefited certain groups. Rural women remain particularly marginalized, least likely to benefit from new opportunities.

In summary, Chad faces considerable geographic, economic, and political challenges that sustain high poverty rates, especially among vulnerable groups like rural women. Sustaining and expanding recent gains requires targeted policy interventions to increase opportunity and security for marginalized populations. Diversifying beyond oil and empowering women and rural groups can achieve inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Overall, while modest progress has occurred, Chad must make further efforts to meet citizens’ basic needs and promote sustainable development.
