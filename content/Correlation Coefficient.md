It is rescaled to be between $-1$ to $1$ , and it is also unit free.

$$
\rho=\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
$$

> How to compute $cov(X,Y)$? See [[Covariance]] 

If $\rho = 1$, it is perfect positive linear relation

If $\rho = -1$, it is perfect negative linear relation

(Most of the time the [[Correlation Coefficient]] would be between when estimate econometrics problem.)

That is, we use *absolute value* $|\rho|$ to reflects the strength of **linear** association between the 2 variables.
