$$
C=wh+V
$$
Here, $C$ means the expenditure you spend on goods, labor earnings (which is $wh$) stands for the hourly wage rate $w$ multiply the hours you work $h$ and  $V$ means the *non-labor income*  . 

Wage rate plays a central role in the labor supply decision.

And now, suppose the workers have 2 uses for the time: work or leisure, and the total time allocated to each activity would be $T$.  So that 

$$
T=h+L
$$
$L$ is the leisure time. Then the budget constraint would be 

$$
C=w(T-L)+V
$$

The intersection of the [Budget Constraint](Budget%20Constraint.md) and the [[Indifference Curve]] would be the combination that could *maximize* the utility. (See [Utility Theory](Utility%20Theory.md) and [Utility Maximizing Problem](Utility%20Maximizing%20Problem.md)
