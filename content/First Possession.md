[[First Possession]] holds the point that nobody owns fugitive property until someone possesses it. And first to "capture" a resource owns it.

"*first in time, first in right*"

However, the [[Tied Ownership]] holds another point of view.

#### Advantage: 

*Simpler to apply* - easy to determine who possessed property first. 

#### Disadvantage:

Create the incentive to invest too much *too early* in order to establish (overproduce problem)

▶ In a contest for title, persons try to get ownership rights transferred to themselves.

▶ Economic efficiency, however, concerns the production of wealth, not the transfer of it.

▶ Investments for the sake of transferring wealth, not producing it, are socially inefficient.

### Example:

The Drilling Example: (Also a kind of [[Nash Equilibrium]])

### The [[Externality]] View

Under the [[First Possession]] rule, people may compete for ownership. => people would not internalize the *effects* on others when making decisions, which is negative [[Externality]]

$A$ decides to make greater traps against $C$, which reduces $B$ 's chance. (See [[Crabbing]])

If there are no [[Transaction Cost]], they could [[Bargaining]] with  each other until the *efficient* outcome reach. (See [[Coase Theorem]]). However, in most cases, [[Transaction Cost]] here is usually *very high!*

How to solve such problems? We introduce the *tax or regulations*, the [[Pigou Tax]] would be one of the famous.
