# The Consumption function of John Maynard Keynes

$C=\overline C + cY$ --------Keynes

$C$ - consumption

$\overline C$ - subsistence level of consumption (As $Y=0$, $C=\overline C$) （也可以理解为维持生计所需要**的消费）

$Y$ - (Disposable) Income

c - Marginal propensity to consume (i.e. MPC, $0<c<1$)

Keynes comes with 3 conjecture: 

1. *Higher income leads to higher consumption and higher saving*

2. *Average Propensity to consume (APC) falls as Y increases*

3. *Consumption doesn't depend on interest rate*

> Note that the data after WW2 doesn't support these ideas, especially the 2, that is in many countries, $\frac{C}{Y}$ doesn't falls as $Y$ increases.

Now We use a model to explain why, that's called the [Life-cycle Hypothesis](Life-cycle%20Hypothesis.md)
