# Tell It by Myself...

Input prices are also determined by the forces of demand and supply. In this case, however, market roles are reversed.

It is a theory related to [[Marginal Productivity]] 

We use $ME_K$ to represent marginal expense of a capital, and $ME_L$ to represent marginal expense of a labor.

So , to maximize the profit, we need

$ME_K=MR_K$

$ME_L=MR_L$

$MR$ means marginal revenue, it is so basic so I won't tell again.

Usually we use $v$ and $w$ to represent the "price", so 

$v=ME_K=MR_K=MP_K*MR$

$w=ME_L=MR_L=MP_L*MR$

In this situation, we can find there are usually only 2 factors in the market, one is capital and one is rental price.

To find out the maximization utility, we come with [[Two-Variable Input Case]]

The *Input Market* is quite different to *Goods Market*

---

Sometimes we find that a firm may not act as a *price taker* , we assume in an extreme case that there is only one buyer (firm) which is the [[Monopsony]].
