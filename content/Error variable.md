# 16.3 Error Variable: required conditions
**Required Conditions for the Error Variable**
1. The probability distribution of ε is normal.
2. The mean of the distribution is 0; that is, E (ε) = 0.
3. The standard deviation of ε is $\sigma_\epsilon$, which is a constant regardless of the value of x.
4. The value of ε associated with any particular value of y is independent of ε associated with any other value of y.
From 1, 2, 3, we can know: For each value of x, y is a normally distributed random variable whose means is $E(y)=\beta_0+\beta_1x$ whose standard deviation is $\sigma_\epsilon$

That is, no matter how the x is , the standard deviation of y is the same.
