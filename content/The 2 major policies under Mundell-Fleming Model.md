# 我的想法

Like the [IS-LM model](IS-LM%20model.md) ,we can also analyze the [Mundell-Fleming Model](Mundell-Fleming%20Model.md) problem in 2 kinds of policies, which are [[Fiscal Policy]] and [[Monetary Policy]]

## The [[Fiscal Policy]]

The fiscal policy affects the $IS^{* }$ curve, for example, the *expansionary fiscal policy* would cause the $IS^{* }$ shifts to the right.

But we have to remind that, although the exchange rate would be higher, but since the $LM^{* }$ is vertical, see [The relationship between Mundell-Fleming Model and LM curve](The%20relationship%20between%20Mundell-Fleming%20Model%20and%20LM%20curve.md)  the output would remain the same.

## The [Monetary Policy](Monetary%20Policy)

A typical [Monetary Policy](Monetary%20Policy) example is when government choose to increase the **Money supply**, since the price level is fixed (see [[Sticky Price Assumption]]), and recall the function $M/P = L(r,Y)$ , the $LM^{* }$ would shifts to the right

> Some thinking: the relationship between the exchange rate and the interest rate is the key issues to analyze these problems.
