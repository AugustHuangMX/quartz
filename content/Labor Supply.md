## Definition of [[Labor Supply]] 

The CPS (Current Population Survey) classifies all people aged 16 or older into three categories: The *employed*, the *unemployed* and the *out of labor force*. So it is clear that

$$
LF = E + U
$$
And the labor force participation rate would be $\frac{LF}{P}$

$P$ means the whole population of the country. Notice that the Unemployment rate would be $\frac{U}{LF}$ , that is we do not count the people that are out of the labor force.

> Until now it is still similar to the topics in the [ECON2005 Macroeconomics MOC](ECON2005%20Macroeconomics%20MOC.md) 

The potential problem of "Hidden Unemployed" may make the unemployment rate much higher than the official figure. See [[Budget Constraint]
