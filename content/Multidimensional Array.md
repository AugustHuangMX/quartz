# Tell It by Myself...

[Multidimensional Array](Multidimensional%20Array.md) is an advanced kind of [Array](Array.md), we usually use this way to declare a [Multidimensional Array](Multidimensional%20Array.md)

```C
type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN]
```

For example,

```C
int x[3][4]
```

It has 3 rows and 4 columns.

And how to initialized a 2D array?

```C
int x[3][4]={
{0,1,2,3}
{4,5,6,7}
{8,9,10,11}
}
```

But you can also write as 

```C
int x[3][4] = {
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11
}
```
