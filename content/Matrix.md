# Tell It by Myself...

From the simple equation from...

$$
\begin{align*}
2x - y &=0\\
-x+2y &=3
\end{align*}
$$
Can be represent by...

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 2 -1  \\ -1  2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}
$$

And we use $A$ to represent the matrix of the coefficients. And $x$ to represent the unknowns. The right hand side we called as $b$.

Then we come to $$
Ax=b
$$
