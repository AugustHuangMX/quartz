### 我的想法

One of the most important fact of [Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Mixed-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) is that it is about *possibility* 

Sometimes a game could not have [Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Pure-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium), but it is always possible to get MSNE in a well-defined game (from lecture note by Professor Sun)

And during the class, we have a very interesting but complicated example see here: [[Complicated NE question]]

Also noted that the number of [Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Mixed-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) is always **odd-number**

## Example

In this case:

| |Heads|Tails|
|---|---|---|
|Heads|1,-1|-1,1|
|Tails|-1,1|1,-1|

We found that there is no such [Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Pure-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) . So we assume the player randomly chooses heads or tails, so the probability would be 1/2 heads and 1/2 tails.

## Simple Conclusion

The [Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Mixed-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) is always come with the **probability**.
