title: "Standard Deviation"
---

The [[Variance]] of $X$ is denoted as $Var(X)$ or $\sigma ^2_X$  

The [[Standard Deviation]] of $X$ is denoted as $\sigma _X$, also the $\sqrt {Var(X)}$ 

A large standard deviation (and variance) means that the probability distribution is quite spread out: a large distance between the outcome and the expected value is anticipated.
