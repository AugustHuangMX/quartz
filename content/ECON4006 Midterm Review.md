### 1.1 The Basic Model

![[截屏2023-10-11 10.55.13.png]]

In this picture, the *Demand Curve* is  $MRPL$, the *Supply Curve* is $w_s$

When it is in the [[Perfect Competition]] , the equilibrium would be $E_0$. However, it is the [[monopsony]] case. 

### 1.2 The Mathematical Model of [[Monopsony]] 

With perfectly competitive labor market, $w$ is given. Define the production function as $Q=F(K,L)$ , the profit function of the firm should be given by:

$$
\Pi = Max_{L,K}pF(K,L)-wL-rK
$$

With no [[Externality]], social $MC$ of recruiting labor $= w$ while the social $MB$ of recruiting labor $=MRPL$ , which reflects to [[Pareto Optimality]]
