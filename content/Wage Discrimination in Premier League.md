# Introduction

Football is a world game,

# Literature Review

# Data

# Method

I plan to just apply the basic OLS regressions as the main modelling approach, and use the WLS methods to verify it. 

First we divide the all the players in 2 groups: local and non-local (English or non-English)  sand we let "england" to be an indicator variable for 1 and 2, that is, non-local is 1 and local is 2. And then comes with and equation:

$$
Y_{g}= X'_g\delta_{g}+\epsilon_g
$$
Notice that the $Y_{g}$  represents the log of the weekly salary of the player in order to handle the skewness.
