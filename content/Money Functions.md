### 我的想法



---

金钱的职能主要有三个 Money can fulfill 3 functions:

1. Medium of exchange
2. Unit of account
3. [[Store of Value]] 

其中如何理解 Medium of exchange 呢？

Money makes it unnecessary for "double coincidence of wants"

Becomes a barter economy ( 以物换物 )

For example, 

A sells wheat and buys potatoes

B sells oranges buys wheat

C buys oranges sells potatoes

他们三个可以使用钱来充当统一的中间媒介

There is no "Double Coincidence of wants"
