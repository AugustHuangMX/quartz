The [[Discounted Utility Model]], also known as DU models, the generalize motivation  is that to answer the case that when we face the options that: 

- Option 1: I pay you $100$ pounds today
- Option 2: I pay you $100+x$ pounds in one month

When $x$ is small, we'd like to choose option 1, vice versa.

The conclusion is that we will require a premium to delay the reward. (impatience)

Using the utility thinking method, we denote a $\delta_1$ that 1 utility tomorrow is the same as $\delta_1$ today.

$$
1\geq \delta_{1}\geq 0
$$

The key formula: 

$$
V(U_0,U_{1},U_{2})=U_{0}+\delta_{1}U_{1}+\delta_{2}U_2
$$
