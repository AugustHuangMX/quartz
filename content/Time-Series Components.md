[[Time-Series Analysis]] 
#Statistics #permanent 
It can be divided in to 4 parts:
1. Long-term trend
2. Cyclical variation
3. Seasonal variation
4. Random variation

## [[Trend]]
A **Trend** is a long-term, relatively smooth pattern or direction exhibited by a series, with a duration of more than 1 year. ![[截屏2023-03-31 11.10.17.png]]
It can be linear but can also be like this: ![[截屏2023-03-31 11.10.35.png]]
The difference between **Cyclical variation** and **Seasonal variation** can be divided into time and factors. Cyclical is usually more than 1 year, since Seasonal is always within 1 year. And Seasonal is more because of the season, festival, and weather.
**Random variation** is due to the unpredictable reasons. But it actually appears in almost all time series, so one of the objectives is to find a way to reduce such random variation to make accurate predictions of the time series.
