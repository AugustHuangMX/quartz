[[Nash Bargaining Model]] involves [[Threat Values]], [[Cooperative Surplus]] and [[Bargaining Power]]

## The famous example: Prisoner's Dilemma

In the previous study in [[Nash Equilibrium]], we know that the *equilibrium* happens in $(D,D)$ , which is not efficient $(C,C)$ ,that means people act *non-cooperatively*. But we know that in the *Prisoner's Dilemma*, people do so is because they do not have [[Bargaining Power]],if they could, they may reach the better outcome (efficiency).

In this case, the [[Threat Values]] would be $(0,0)$ , the [[Cooperative Surplus]] is $2$. They could reach the efficient outcome by *binding contract* which is $(C,C)$ 

> Binding Contract means no cheating, everyone do as they say.

But this is the case happens when they have *equal bargaining power* , suppose player 1 has full [[Bargaining Power]] but player 2 has none. Then player 1 could ask player 2 to pay $1 or $0.999999 to him, since 0.000001 > -1, player 2 would agree the contract, in this case, player 1 get the full [[Cooperative Surplus]].

The same is in the pollution problem.

Usually in such problems, we follow those steps:

1. What happens in the efficient outcome? (when no rights allocation)
2. What happens without bargaining?
3. What is the [[Cooperative Surplus]]
4. How about the results after bargaining?
5. Provide the results.
