Suppose the government wants to purchase 3 lands lots to build a school, which creates a social value of 100. And each land owner values his lot at 20.

However, *since if there is one owner that doesn't allow the purchase, the deal can't be made.* Since every land seller may recognize this problem, they made make a relatively higher price than the original value.


In Chinese, this is called “抵制/坚持问题”
