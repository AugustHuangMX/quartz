#permanent #Econ/Macro 

It shows a relation between **Saving** and **Wealth**

[Life-cycle Hypothesis](Life-cycle%20Hypothesis.md) and [Consumption according to Keynes](Consumption%20according%20to%20Keynes.md)

For example

One of the important influence factor is the *retirement date*, so people may be afraid if they retire, they would have less income.

They think in order to maintain the consumption during the working years, they need to save during youth.

Suppose a consumer expects to live another $T$ years, and has a wealth of $W$, and expect to earn income $Y$ per year until he retires $R$ years from now. What level of consumption will the consumer choose if he wants stable consumption over the course of his life?

| |Yr 1|Yr 2|Yr 3|Yr 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|saving|100|100|100|100|
|wealth|0|100|200|300|

**Solving**

It is easy to get $C=(W+RY)/T$, or can be described as $W/T+(R/T)Y$ (We write like this because we can see the influence made by whether wealth or income)

That is, the economy's income can be described as 
$$
C=\alpha W+\beta Y
$$

## Comparison between Keynes

1. The [Life-cycle Hypothesis](Life-cycle%20Hypothesis.md) point out that the consumption is based on *wealth* and *income*
2. The APC of Keynes is $APC=\overline C/Y+c$ while for [Life-cycle Hypothesis](Life-cycle%20Hypothesis.md) is $APC=\alpha (W/Y)+\beta$
