It is a typical example in [[Coase Bargaining]].

*Important concept*: once the $WTP>WTA$, the trade could happen.

In this [[Rancher and Farmer Bargaining]] case, a *ranch* and a *farm* are adjacent. The contradiction is that the cattle raised on the ranch can damage the crops grown on the farm.

And the table is here:

An important concept is that, who has the right?

Lets do as the thinking procedure list in the [[Coase Bargaining]]. We found that the social optimum happens when the number of steers is 2. (Social Gains 2)

## Rancher has the right

If rancher has the right, and without [[Bargaining]], of course he would raise 4 steers, which is definitely inefficient.

And the farmer could reduce the lost by [[Bargaining]], for example, to reach the *efficient* case, the $WTP$ would be $10-3=7$ , and the $WTA$ for the rancher would be $10-5 = 5$ ,since $WTP-WTA>0$ , the [[Bargaining]] could happen.

## Farmer has the right

If farmer has the right to put an injunction on raising steers, the method is similar.

## Move forward: If we can build a fence...

Suppose a fence costs $\$7$ to prevent damages to the crops.

Above is the new situation. The efficient situation becomes when the number of steers is 4.

### If farmer has the right

Just like we analyzed before, the farmer could put an injunction. Without bargaining, the rancher raise no steers. Now he wants to "buy" the right to raise steers. So his $WTP$ would be $10$,

**Wonderful thing**: the $WTA$ of the farmer is not $10$ ! It is $7$ since he could build a fence by himself!

Think about what is a fence costs $\$9$ ?
