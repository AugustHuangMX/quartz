### 我的想法

方差分析（ANOVA）This technique allows us to compare 3 (usually 3) or more populations of interval data. And it is extremely powerful.

It can be considered as an extension of the [[Student's t-test]] 

[[Confidence and Significance Level]]

$\overline {\overline x}$ is the *grand mean*. $$\overline {\overline x}=\frac{\sum ^k _{j=1}\sum ^{n_j} _{i=1}x_{ij}}{n}$$ 

  

---

It can be divided by [[One-Way Analysis of Variance]] and [[Two-Factor Analysis of Variance]]
