The joint probability distribution of two discrete random variables, say X and Y, is the probability that the random variables simultaneously take on certain values, say $x$ and $y$. The probabilities of all possible $(x, y)$ combinations sum to $1$. 

The joint probability distribution can be written as the function $Pr(X = x, Y = y)$ , which is the prob that happen together.

Reflect to the table, the probability would simply be the multiply of the 2 independent probability of the event. 

For example:

In this table, it is easily to tell that, $Pr(X=0, Y=1)=0.15$ and so on. And next we lead in the [[Marginal Probability Distribution]], it is just the adding up from the [[Joint Distribution]].
