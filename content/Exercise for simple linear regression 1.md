Just calculate the [[Covariance]] and the variance of x.
We can use $e_i=y_i-\hat{y_i}$ to estimate how well it is. And the deviations between the actual data points are called **residuals** 
The residuals are observations of the error variable. The minimized sum of squared deviations is called the **sum of squares for error** ,which is called SSE.

> To infer information about the population, we need statistical inference techniques, which are described subsequently.

感悟练习题：
16.1-16.17 的习题的考点并不难
主要就考察协方差和方差的运算，会公式就行
会画图就行
