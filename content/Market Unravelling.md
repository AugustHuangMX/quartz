[[Market Unravelling]] typically means that a market break down due to the [[Asymmetric Information]], It typically happens when sellers have more information about the quality of a product than buyers. In such markets, it can be difficult for high-quality products or services to command appropriate prices because buyers cannot distinguish them from lower-quality offerings. ( See [[The Market for Lemons]])

This is often associated with the concept of [[Adverse Selection]].
