# Chapter 4 Selection Structures: if and switch statements

Condition are expressions that evaluate to either *true* or *false*

In C, we use `0` and `1` to represent.

We use `&&` to represent 'and', `||` to represent 'or' （并集和交集的思想）

At the same time, we could use  `!` to represent 'not' for example, `! =` is not equal.

All the symbols have the priority of the procedure, so it is often useful to use the *brackets*
