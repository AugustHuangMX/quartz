For consumer utility maximization, suppose a consumer wishes to buy 2 goods. Money does not bring utility directly, but he faces a budget constraint.

The consumer's problem is 

$$
max\ u(x,y)\ s.t.\ p_xx + p_yy\leq w
$$
And we have to apply to [[Largrangian Multiplier]] $\lambda$,

$$
L = u(x,y)+\lambda(w-p_xx-p_yy)
$$

Then take derivates with respect to the control variables in order to get the FOCs.

The results would give you  $\frac{u_x(x,y)}{p_x}=\frac{u_y(x,y)}{p_y}$, which means spending $\$ \epsilon$ more on $x$ or on $y$ should give you the same [[Marginal Utility]]
