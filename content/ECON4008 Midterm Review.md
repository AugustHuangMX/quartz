It would also be a good idea to make sure you know how to solve the questions in the problem sets (and similar ones), at least after seeing the solutions. In the exam, most of the questions will be numerical ones. And the format will be similar to the numerical problem sets. You will see a description of a scenario, and be asked to analyze various questions arising in the scenario.

## Efficiency

Notice the difference between [[Pareto Improvement]] and [[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]]. *Everyone or the whole society?*
