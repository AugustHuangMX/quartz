# Tell It by Myself...

The utility function:

$u_i=x_i G$ , where $G=\sum g_i$ and $x_i+g_i=1$ 

## For the person himself

His constraint would be $x_i+pg_i=M_i$ and $M_i$ would be his [Endowment](Endowment.md), you can consider in the *all the resource he has*

Here , $x_i$ maybe the *private* part of the individual, like the one in the [Lindahl Equilibrium](Lindahl%20Equilibrium.md). $g_1$ represents the *public* part by the individual, that means, 

## Understanding

Since $x_i$ is all the private part, so you don't need to multiply anything, what you have is what you consume. But $p$ here is the price of the public goods and you should multiply $g_i$ and $g_i$ is what you consume for the public goods.

## To reach the optimal:

We should consider in the [Pareto Optimality](Pareto%20Optimality.md) so we need to use the [Largrangian Multiplier](Largrangian%20Multiplier.md) in order to get it.

## The Utility Equation

$$
u_i(x_i,g_i+\sum_{j\neq i}g_j)
$$

You will find that, $g_i+\sum_{j\neq i}g_j$ is just the sum up of  $G$ , so I think it can also be represented by 

$$
u_i(x_i,G)
$$
