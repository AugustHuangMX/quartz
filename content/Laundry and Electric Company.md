### Background

*The E Electric Company emits smoke, which dirties the wash at the L Laundry.
▶ E can abate this external cost by installing scrubbers on its stacks, and L can reduce the damage by installing filters on its ventilation system.
▶ When E does not install scrubbers, its profits are $1000 (regardless of what the laundry does).
▶ When L does not install filters and does not suffer pollution damages (because E has installed scrubbers), L’s profits are $300.
▶ Pollution destroys $200 of L’s profits.
▶ L can avoid this by installing filters at a cost of $100, or E can avoid it by installing scrubbers at a cost of $500.*

So we can conclude a [[Nash Equilibrium]] table:
