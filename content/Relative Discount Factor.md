The [[Relative Discount Factor]] between period, for example, period 0 and 1 is the number of Utils the decision maker has to get in period 0 to compensate for loss of 1 Util in period 1. Therefore, the discount factor is the amount $x$ that satisfies:

$$
V(U_{0}+x,U_{1}-1,U_{2})=V(U_{0},U_{1},U_{2})
$$
The definition of the [[Relative Discount Factor]] between periods 0 and 2, 1 and 2 is the same.
