Asymmetric Information is different to the [[Full Information]], that could lead to inefficient situation. 

We usually use the [[Game Theory]] to make the strategy.

> It is in a game with uncertainty, information that one player has but the other does not.

There is a simple setting model called [[principal-agent model]],


## One famous example:   [[The Market for Lemons]]
