Asymmetric Information is different to the [[Full Information]], that could lead to inefficient situation. 

We usually use the [[Game Theory]] to make the strategy.

> It is in a game with uncertainty, information that one player has but the other does not.

There is a simple setting model called [[principal-agent model]],

 One famous example:   [[The Market for Lemons]]

## How to solve (fix) this problem?

- The markets are pretty resilient.
- The sellers would provide some self-fixes that arise: for example
1. Third-party certifications
2. Money-back guarantee
3. Online reviews/comments

- Or provide different kinds of insurance by "screening". Different menus are offered to attract different types.
