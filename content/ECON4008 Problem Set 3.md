### Question 1

There are a lot of similarities compared with *Bomber v. Particular Gypsum Co.* case and *Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co.* here.

1. They are near from each other: They are located in Section 38 and 39.
2. There was a private externality caused by the factory.
3. The injured party consists of a large number of individuals.
4. It is also substantial damages associated with the public nuisance. And the emitting dust would continue if the company keeps producing.
5. The significant transaction cost exists, for there are about 100 land owners in section 39 , and the hold-out problem could be serious.
6. The loss of the relocation ($12,437,000) is much higher than the compensation (100 x 1000 = $100,000)

### Question 2

From an efficiency standpoint, *damages are usually favored* over injunctions when transaction costs are potentially high.When transaction costs are high, damages become a straightforward method to compensate the harmed party directly, without seeking solutions through possibly long and complex legal processes. If we use the injunction way, it may happen a negotiation between two parties to reach a solution, which increases the transaction cost and make the *hold-out* problem become worse.While damages don't need it.


### Question 3

If there is high possibility of technological advancements in preventing emissions of particulate dust, it may be better to impose a *temporary damage*, for this would allow Particular Gypsum Co. some time to adopt new technology, with the cessation of damages once the new technology is implemented. The *permanent damage* would increase the long-term cost, and increase the burdens for the company, and decrease the motivation to improve the technology.

### Question 4

For the courts, it is cheaper to impose an damage, for it doesn't need the court to make further supervision or enforcement. While the damages only require the very first allocation and the amount of compensation.

Compared with permanent and temporary cost, since the temporary cost takes a high transaction cost (the plaintiff has to return to court in order to receive additional damages), the permanent damages are cheaper and easier for the court to administer.

### Question 5

Under this assumption, the 100 individuals becomes one, and this highly reduces the *hold-out problem*, and it would also reduce the transaction cost, the injunction might be imposed in this case. Also, the allocation of the 100 people would increase their bargaining power, the Bomber Development Corporation might have a stronger incentive and ability to negotiate a solution with Particular Gypsum Co. The court might encourage them to come to a *bargain* for a proper compensation, which is another reason for injunction.

### Question 6

"Coming to nuisance" refers to a legal doctrine which prevents a party from claiming nuisance if said nuisance was present, and the party knew of that nuisance before they acquired the property subject to the nuisance. (Source: [coming to the nuisance | Wex | US Law | LII / Legal Information Institute (cornell.edu)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/coming_to_the_nuisance))

Here satisfies that the purchaser already knew the nuisance exists, and accept the $1000 discount for this damage. If we don't apply to this law,  the high transaction cost might be very high that each of the 100 people could individually ask for compensation to the Gypsum Co. one by one. "Coming to nuisance" could solve this problem by originally allocated the transaction price in the landing price, and make the market much more efficient. 

### Question 7

1. **Property Rules**: Property rules protect rights through injunctions, allowing the rights-holder to prevent others from infringing on their rights. In this scenario, infringement is not allowed unless the rights-holder consents. This often works well when transaction costs are low, as the rights-holder and potential infringer can negotiate freely whether and on what terms the rights might be transferred.

2. **Liability Rules**:  Liability rules protect rights through damages, whereby an infringer can infringe on another's rights but must pay compensation. This often works well when transaction costs are high or when negotiation is impractical or difficult.

In this case, if we apply to the *property rules*, Bomber could impose an injunction to stop the dust produced by Gypsum Co. If we apply to the *liability rules*, Bomber may ask for damages (whether *permanent* or *temporary*)
