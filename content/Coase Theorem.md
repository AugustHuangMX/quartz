It is a similar concept to [[Pigou]] Theorem. But it mostly focus on the market side (while [[Pigou]]) is on the government side. 

It's about a theory that, the market could adjust themselves. That means, if 2 firms in the Market would realize the existence of the [[Externality]], and they have abilities to bargain freely, then it would lead to the result which both firms maybe satisfied. And this is called the [Coase Theorem](Coase%20Theorem.md)


---

The [Coase Theorem](Coase%20Theorem.md) should consider in 2 sides, for example if the problem is between firm A and firm B about the "river problem" (the one discussed in class, A is nearby the upstream of a river produces chemical product, while B is under it and suffered from it) , then we have to discuss in 2 sides.

### If Firm B is the owner of the river...

Remind that firm B is under the river, so that firm A should pay firm B in order to produce, once it meets the $WTA$ (willingness to accept), the firm B would accept the A's production

#### How to calculate $WTA$ ?

Note that the $WTA = MSC - MC$ ([Social Marginal Cost](Social%20Marginal%20Cost.md) - Marginal Cost). Because only if others pay you the *difference value* you will accept the advice.

Then we can come to this figure...

### The Trade Balance

So, after evaluating the relationship, we could come to the balance between A and B

Here, the firm A is more like a buyer, because he **needs** the firm B to allow him to pollute, and firm B is the supplier, he will choose whether to "sell"

### If Firm A is the owner of the river...

Now, if firm A is the owner, then it would be for firm B to bargain A to pollute less. ( Because , if firm B doesn't exists, firm A could pollute as large as it wants)

Now, 攻守之势异也. Firm A act as a seller, while firm B is the buyer. So that's the reason why professor Sun would change inverse the *quantity curve* because the meaning behind it is **the change of the  "seller-buyer" relationship.**

## Conclusion

The conclusion is that no matter the owner of the river is who, once there is no [Transaction Cost](Transaction%20Cost.md), the market solution would come the the Social Optimum ($Q^{** }$) and this is the brief insight of the [Coase Theorem](Coase%20Theorem.md)

### The role of  the [[Transaction Cost]]

Notice that the [Coase Theorem](Coase%20Theorem.md) is under an assumption that they have no cost on the transaction. If the cost of this is too high, the deal maybe not appear, see [[Externalities with High Transaction Cost]]
