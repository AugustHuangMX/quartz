[[Time-Series Components]]
#Statistics #permanent 
This is typically compared with the [[Moving Averages]], because the moving average has some huge disadvantages that it will lose the first and last sets of time periods. If the time-series only has a few observations, it could lose some important information (for example, only 5 years?)
The second reason is that the [[Moving Averages]] method will ignore a lot of *previous* observation / information.
But, we can use the [[Exponential Smoothing]] method to solve this problem!
In conclusion, we have
$S_t=wy_t+(1-w)S_{t-1}\ for\ t\geq2$
where
	$S_t$ is Exponentially smoothed time series at time period $t$
	$y_t$ is the time series at time period t
	$w$ is the ==smoothing constant==
You can understand the $S_t$ as a $y'_t$ ,which means it is after a smoothing procedure.
And, if we start from $t=1$, we could get
$S_t=wy_t+(1-w)y_{t-1}+w(1-w)^2y_{t-2}+...+(1-w)^{t-1}$
>There is no $w$ in the last component. See it carefully.

Different choose of value $w$ could change the deal of smoothing. Normally a large value of $w$ could has a little smoothing, vice versa.

附上 R 语言代码：
```R
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
# 加载数据
sales <- c(39, 37, 61, 58, 18, 56, 82, 27, 41, 69, 49, 66, 54, 42, 90, 66)

# 定义指数平滑系数alpha
w1 <- 0.2
w2 <- 0.7

# 计算初始的预测值
pred1 <- sales[1]
pred2 <- sales[1]
# 进行指数平滑处理
for (i in 2:length(sales)) {
  pred1[i] <- w1 * sales[i] + (1 - w1) * pred1[i-1]
}
for (i in 2:length(sales)) {
  pred2[i] <- w2 * sales[i] + (1 - w2) * pred2[i-1]
}


sales_df <- data.frame(
  Month = 1:16,
  Sales = sales,
  Prediction1 = pred1,
  Prediction2 = pred2
)
# 输出预测结果
print(pred1)
print(pred2)
ggplot(data = sales_df, aes(x = Month)) +
  geom_line(aes(y =sales , color = "red"),size = 1)+
  geom_line(aes(y =pred1 , color = "blue"), size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
  geom_line(aes(y =pred2))


```
