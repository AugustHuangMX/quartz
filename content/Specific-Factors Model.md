Recall that [[Ricardian Trade Theory]] implies that trade could benefit everyone.

---

Two main reasons why trade affects on the income distribution: 

1. Industries differ in factors of production they demand (+ factor endowment) recall the HO model ([[Heckscher-Ohlin Model]] )
2. Resources can't move immediately => that's why we would introduce the [[Specific-Factors Model]].

# Comparison between [[Heckscher-Ohlin Model]] and [[Specific-Factors Model]] 


| HO model | SF Model |
| ---- | ---- |
| Factors are able to move between countries | Not all factors are mobile |
| Long-Run model | Short-Run model |

# Setting

- 2 countries
- 2-Sector: Cheese ($C$) and Wine ($W$)
- 3-Factor: Labour ($L$), Capital ($K$), and **Land ($T$)**
- $Q_{C}=F_{C}(L,K),Q_{W}=F_{W}(L,T)$  *Difference:* in [[Heckscher-Ohlin Model]], $Q_{W}=F_{W}(L,K)$
- $L$ is used in both sectors and **mobile across sectors**
- $K$ is specific to C-production 
- $T$ is specific to W-production 
- Factor price: wage ($w$), rent for capital ($r$), rent for land ($t$)

We also want to know who are the "winners" and "losers" in the trade.

# Model

## Home 

### Equilibrium before trade 

- $MPL_{W}/MPL_{C}=P_{C}/P_{W}$ *Recall the intercept term between the utility curve and the [[Indifference Curve]]*
- $K$ and $T$ is specific factors, while $L$ can be used in both sectors. So the problem becomes the allocation problem of $L$.

From *O*, if we goes down, that means we allocate more labors in the cheese industry, if we go left, that means we allocate more labors in the wine industry.

In the competitive market, $w_{W}=P_{W}MPL_{W}$ and $W_{C}= P_{C}MPL_{C}$

## Changes in Factor [[Endowment]] 

### Workers

Both $w/P_{C}$ and $w/P_{W}$ increase

The welfare of workers increase 

### Capital owners

$\frac{r_{C}}{P_{C}}= MPK_{C}$ decreases (Assume $\% \Delta K > \%\Delta L_{C}$) and thus $r_{C}/P_{W}$ decreases.



### Equilibrium before trade 

When countries open their markets...

$(P_{C}/P_{W})$ changes as a results of trade

**Compare**:

![[截屏2024-02-22 10.20.56.png|500]]

- No change in $MPT_{W}$
- No change in real rent rate: $r'_{C}/P'_{C}=MPK_{C}$, $\frac{r'_{C}}{P'_{W}}=\frac{P_{C}}{P_{W}}\times MPK_{C}$
