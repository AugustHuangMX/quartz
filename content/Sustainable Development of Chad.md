1. Introduction

Chad, a landlocked country in Central Africa, confronts substantial challenges in its quest for sustainable development. As a developing nation, Chad struggles to address these issues, but the government remains ambitious and has achieved some progress in various areas.

2. Economic Sustainability

As discussed in the poverty chapter, Chad's economy heavily relies on oil exports, leaving it susceptible to price fluctuations. For example, the price could be as high as  $79 per barrel in 2010 but can be low of $17.02 in 1995. This instability can be detrimental to a country like Chad, which relies heavily on oil revenues. To achieve economic sustainability, the country must diversify its economic sectors and infrastructure development, such as the Chad Railway expansion, has made progress and holds the potential to boost economic growth and create employment opportunities. Although the government has implemented policies promoting foreign direct investment, additional efforts are needed to attract investments beyond the oil sector and generate sustainable jobs.

3. Social Sustainability

Chad has made significant progress in enhancing access to education, with primary school enrollment rates rising from 32% in 1975 to 94% in 2019. Nevertheless, gender disparities and insufficient funding continue to hinder universal education. In the healthcare sector, health program implementation has led to improvements, but the high infant mortality rate (69% in 2019) and the prevalence of infectious diseases like HIV (1.2% of the population aged 15-49 in 2019) signal ongoing challenges. Targeted poverty alleviation programs are crucial for ensuring social sustainability and improving Chad's population's well-being.

4. Environmental Sustainability

Chad grapples with environmental challenges such as water scarcity, land degradation, and deforestation. Effective natural resource management is vital for environmental sustainability. The government's efforts to tackle climate change through adaptation and mitigation strategies are laudable; however, more emphasis should be placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy sources. Preserving Chad's biodiversity demands a dedicated commitment to safeguarding its unique ecosystems and wildlife.

5. Challenges and Recommendations

Major obstacles to Chad's sustainable development include political instability, limited resources, and climate vulnerabilities. To address these challenges, enhanced international cooperation is necessary to provide financial and technical assistance. Targeted investments in vital sectors such as education, healthcare, and renewable energy can improve Chad's sustainable development prospects. Implementing effective governance and policy frameworks is essential to ensure transparency, accountability, and the efficient use of resources.

6. Conclusion

In conclusion, Chad has made progress towards sustainable development, but considerable challenges persist. The country's future hinges on its ability to diversify its economy, ameliorate social welfare, and protect its environment. By addressing these challenges through targeted investments, effective governance, and international cooperation, Chad can lay the foundation for a more sustainable and prosperous future.
