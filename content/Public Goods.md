### 我的想法

公共商品，排他性、外部性，所谓是一旦被生产出来，那么在一定范围之内，每个人都会因此收益。


---

The public goods have 2 features, one is [[Nonrival]] and another is [[Nonexclusive]] 

|   |Exclusive|Non-Exclusive|
|---|----|---|
| Rivalry|Private Goods|Common Pool Resources|
|Non-Rivalry|Club Goods|Private Goods|

### Problems

The public goods will also face some problems, because since we know everyone would benefit from the public goods. So that everyone could have the incentive to be a [[Free-Rider]], then there would be some methods regarding to the [Game Theory](Game%20Theory.md) .

### Roommate problem

In this game, both roommates would choose not to clean the room. (although they are willing to get a clean room). However, this situation is inferior to which both roommates clean the room, so there need a [[Pareto Improvement]] to force them to do so. Like *Compulsory Taxation*. It's like a prisoners’ dilemma which is far from the [[Pareto Optimality]]
