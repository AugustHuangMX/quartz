### 我的想法

Differences between the [Mundell-Fleming Model](Mundell-Fleming%20Model.md) and the [[IS curve]] is that the [Mundell-Fleming Model](Mundell-Fleming%20Model.md) adds in the $NX$ (net export)

So the equation would be 

Now, $Y=C+I+G+NX$

$=C(Y-T)+I(r^{* })+G+NX(e)$

Where, $NX=export - import$, $e$ is the real exchange rate, and $\frac{\delta I}{\delta r}<0$, $\frac{\delta NX}{\delta e}<0$
