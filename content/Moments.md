Both mean and variance belong to a class of measures, called [[Moments]]

Raw [[Moments]]:

$$
\mu^{(j)}=E(X^j)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^jf(x)dx
$$

Central [[Moments]]:

$$
\sigma^{(j)}=E(X-\mu)^j=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^jf(x)dx
$$

The [[Mean]] is also called the first (raw) [[Moments]], and the [[Variance]] is called the second (central) [[Moments]].

The third moment is about *Skewness* and the fourth moment is about *Kurtosis*. In the course [[ECON3002 Econometrics MOC]], we use the first two more.

In Chinese, we usually called it as “x 阶矩”, like "二阶距"
