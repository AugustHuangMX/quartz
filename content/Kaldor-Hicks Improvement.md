Unlike [[Pareto Improvement]], a [[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]] can create winners and some losers. Once the whole efficiency (or outcome) improve, we call it as [[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]] (no need to let at least one get better)

We will consider the law A is a better law than B since moving from B to A is a [[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]]. (See the content in [[ECON4008 Law and Economics]])

Since the [[Pareto Improvement]] is good for everyone as an individual, the [[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]] is good for the society as a whole. That is, if a law/rule is a [[Pareto Improvement]], it must be a [[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]].
