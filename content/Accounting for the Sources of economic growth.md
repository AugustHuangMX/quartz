It is a  very important equation in Macro, which is also named as “增长核算公式”, it aims to find out the growth in total output $\Delta Y / Y$

For the Intermediate Macro, there are only 3 different sources, which are

1. Contribution of capital stock (K)
2. Contribution of labor
3. Contribution of technology

In conclusion, the [[Growth Accounting Equation]] could be expressed as: 

$$
\frac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \alpha \frac{\Delta K}{K}+(1-\alpha) \frac{\Delta L}{L}+(1-\alpha) \frac{\Delta E}{E}
$$

但是在网上也有这种写法：

$$
\frac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \alpha _K \frac{\Delta K}{K}+\alpha _L \frac{\Delta L}{L}+\frac{\Delta A}{A}
$$

也许是说明 $\alpha _K$ 和 $\alpha _L$ 不一定是互补的关系，只有当是 [[Cobb-Douglas Production Function]] 才会有这样的性质

> The value of $\alpha$ is usually around 0.25-3

Then we can come to [[Solow Residual]], which is described as

$$
(1-\alpha) \frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{\Delta A}{A}
$$

Also, we can calculate the Relative Contribution to test which component has a great influence. (maybe like [[Principal Component Analysis]]?)
