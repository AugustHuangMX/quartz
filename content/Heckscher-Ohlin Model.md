There are several factors of production.

CA depends on the differences 


## The Production Function

$Y=F(L,K)$

Setting $Q_{i}= F_{i}(L_{i}K_{i})$, where $i = W,C$

And it follows [[Constant Return to Scale]] .

Recall the definition of diminishing marginal returns

## Model Set-up

2 Country, 2 Sector, 2 Factor Model 

### Important Assumption

#### Factors

- Aggregate endowment of factors is fixed
- Factors are completely mobile across sectors
- Factors are completely immobile across countries
- Wage ($w$) and rent ($r$) determined in national factor markets
- Aggregate factor abundance differs across countries 

#### Production Function 

$Q=L^{b}K^{1-b}$

- Indifference in production technologies across countries 
- Differences in production technologies across sectors
