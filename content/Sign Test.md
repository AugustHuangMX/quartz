[[Non-parameter Statistic]]

3 requirements

1. The problem objective is to compare two populations.
2. The data are ordinal.
3. The experimental design is matched pairs

## The Hypothesis

$H_0$ : The 2 population locations are the same

That also means

$H_0$ : $p=.5$

Recall the [[Binomially Distribution]]

Standardized test statistic is 

$z=\frac{x-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$

$x$ is the number that are positive.





## The [[Friedman Test]] and the [[Sign Test]]
The relationship between them is same as between the [[Kruskal Wallis Test]] and the [[Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test]] .
