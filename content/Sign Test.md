[[Non-parameter Statistic]]
#input #permanent 
3 requirements
1. The problem objective is to compare two populations.
2. The data are ordinal.
3. The experimental design is matched pairs

## The Hypothesis
$H_0$ : The 2 population locations are the same
That also means
$H_0$ : $p=.5$
Recall the [[binomially distribution]]
Standardized test statistic is 
$z=\frac{x-np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$
$x$ is the number that are positive.





## The [[Friedman Test]] and the [[Sign Test]]
The relationship between them is same as between the [[Kruskal Wallis Test]] and the [[Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test]] .
