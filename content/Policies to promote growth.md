# Evaluating the rate of saving
Q: Is the saving rate in US too low or too high compare with its golden-rule situation?
That is, we have to compare the $MPK-\delta$ and the $(n+g)$

Now the problem is how to encourage people to save more?
The famous method is to control the *Tax*
# Allocating the economy's saving
