[[Non-parameter Statistic]]
#fleeting #Statistics 
## Application
1. The problem objective is to compare 2 or more populations
2. The data are either ordinal or interval, but not normal
3. The samples generated from a randomized block experiment（随机区组检验）


## Hypothesis
$H_0$: The locations of all $k$ populations are the same.
$H_1$: At least two population locations differ.
## Test Statistic
The test statistic of Friedman, is denoted by F.
Here, $b=$ number of blocks.

We can use this method to test whether 2 populations differ.
> Use the Friedman Test to test whether the difference exists, *but* if we want to know the position difference. We have to use the [[Sign Test]]
