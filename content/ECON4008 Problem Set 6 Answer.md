| | Cost of Care| Risk (Prob of Harm)|
|---|---|---|
|Care|2|3\%|
|No Care|0|9%|


Production cost $=10$, harm in na accident $=100$

## In an efficient level:

With care: social cost = production cost + cost of care + expected harm which is 15

Without care: $10+9\% \times 100 = 19 > 15$

The consumers' $WTP: 40,20,17,13,11$

*Note that the victims are the third party*

If you (producers) not care, so the price would be relatively low, so you can attract more consumers. Your choice would be "no care"

Then, how many customers would like to purchase the good?

The price would be $10$, the expected harm is not born from the consumers, so the financial cost is only the price itself.

Customers are strictly liable:

Care: 

market price = $MC = 10+2=12$

Perceived Price = Market Price + Expect harm = $12+3\%\times 100=15$

No care:

market price = $MC = 10=10$

Perceived Price = Market Price + Expect harm = $12+9\%\times 100=19$


## Negligence

Care:

Price Charged = 12

Perceived Price = 15

No Care:

Price Charged = 19

Perceived Price = 19

## Imperfect Risk Perception --Only average

No Liability

Care & all other firms choose not to provide care: 10+2

Perceived cost = 12 + average risk x 100

No care: 10

Perceived Cost = 10 + average risk x 100
