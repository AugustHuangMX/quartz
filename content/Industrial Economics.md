The course would mainly include 2 concepts, which are [[Monopoly]] and [[Oligopoly]].

# Lecture 1 Introduction

Fundamental Question of economics is that it is crucial to understand how production and exchange are organized.

How are products allocated to the people?

A: (mostly) through the market 

Perfect market is the desire market structure

## How do IO Economics Answer Questions?

Using a combination of

[[Micro Theory]], especially [[Game Theory]]


# [[Perfect Competition]] and [[Monopoly]]

## Firm Behavior 

### Profits 

$\pi = TR-TC = P\times Q - TVC - FC$

> TVC stands for total variable costs. They vary with the level of output, like labor and material inputs, capital depreciation, etc.

Our definition of costs should be based on economically-based [[Opportunity Cost]], not accounting costs.

Specifically, in a cost function, if we face an equation like:

$C(q)=100+10q^2$, it is easy to justify that $100$ is the fixed cost, while the variable costs, is $10q^2$. (Since it depends on the quantity.)

We will sometimes refer to two concepts:

- [[Economies of scale]]
- [[Economies of scope]]
