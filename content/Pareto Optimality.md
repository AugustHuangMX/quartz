### 我的想法

 中文名：帕累托最优

It is a way that when allocating the resources, when do not decrease everyone's utility, increase someones' (or only one's) utility

When there is no solution that can be better when this agent does better and nobody does worse, so we could call it as [Pareto Optimality](Pareto%20Optimality.md), it is always connected with the [Game Theory](Game%20Theory.md).

It is possible that one "game" has more than one Pareto solution.

## The analyze process

An example in the table:

|1,3|2,2|
|---|---|
|3,1|1,2|

In this case, we first exam first box: 1,3

- We find that no other choice would increase one's utility while doesn't decrease others', so it is the Pareto Solution

Same for 2,2 and 3,1

However, when we look at "1,2", we find that the second box, 2,2 could do so, so the fourth box isn't the Pareto Solution.

## Pareto Solution is not stable

Think about the case in the [Game Theory](Game%20Theory.md) , the player in the game is always trying to maximize his own utility, so it is clear that Pareto Solution is not stable.
