It is similar to the $WTP$ and $WTA$, but it depends on who owns the *property rights*. The [[Threat Values]] means the payoffs someone could get if *no* agreement is reached.

For example, if I am a polluter, and I could earn $\$100,000$ from the factory, so my [[Threat Values]]  would be $\$100,000$.
