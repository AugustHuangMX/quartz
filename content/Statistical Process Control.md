#Statistics 

This page, which is also called as *SPC*, is We usually use mainly 2 methods  to control the quality,

1. The first one is to inspect the unit to check the quality whether it is good or not. *But this method has a lot of drawbacks, one of those is that the cost may be too high*.
2. The second is called the **prevention approach**, this method has an advantage is that could be previous than the production, using the [[Hypothesis test]], and this method not inspect the production itself, but inspect the process to predict when will be the bad production happen.

One of the most important part of the quality control, would be [[Process Variation]]

However, the SPC process is slightly different from the [Hypothesis test](Hypothesis%20test.md).
