# Tell It by Myself...

If in a game, there exists not only [Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Pure-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) but also [Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Mixed-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md), this means the would be a [Multiple Equilibria](Multiple%20Equilibria.md). In fact, it usually appears in the Nash Equilibrium test questions.

## Battle of Sexes

|2,1|0,0|
|---|---|
|0,0|1,2|

There would be in this case, where 2 [Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Pure-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) and 1 [Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Mixed-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md) (notice that there could be more than one [Pure-Strategy Nash Equilibrium](Pure-Strategy%20Nash%20Equilibrium.md))
