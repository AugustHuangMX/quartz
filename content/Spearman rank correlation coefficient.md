It is also a technique of [[Non-parameter Statistic]]
#permanent #Statistics 
This is a update of the [[Correlation Coefficient]], Because sometimes the variables maybe ordinal, or the normality requirement can't be satisfied.
So we have to use this technique to solve such problems
*Spearman correlation coefficient* is labeled as $\rho _s$, *sample statistic* used to estimate its value is labeled as $r_s$
$$
r_s=\frac{s_{ab}}{s_as_b}
$$
Notice that $a$ and $b$ are the ranks of $x$ and $y$ ,
## Hypothesis
**Always remember we have to estimate whether $x$ and $y$ have linear relationship.**
$H_0$: $\rho_s = 0$ Wilcoxon rank sum test $H_1$: $\rho_s ≠ 0$
We have to refer to the table to test whether to refuse the hypothesis.

When $n>30$, the test statistic becomes
