### 我的想法

In python, a list is a sequence of values separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.

```python
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

>Lists may contain items of different types, but in practice they are often used to store items of the same type

Similar to [Array](Array.md) in C and [Tuple](Tuple.md) in Python itself, all elements start at location 0.

And what is more similar to [Array](Array.md) is it is *mutable*!

For example, 

```python
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
nums[0] = 3
```

Then the element will change to 

```python
nums
[3,2,3,4,5]
```
