If [[Private Goods]] are owned publicly, they tend to be over-utilized/over-exploited.（过度开发/利用）, and this is called the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], there are 2 ways to avoid them:

1. Give the ownership to an individual who would have the appropriate incentive to invest in its preservation or use and to exclude others from using it
2. Devise an enforceable and effective method of restricting access to the common resource.
