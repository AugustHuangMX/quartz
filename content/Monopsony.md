The basic graph of it could be this, which consists of $w^s$ (stands for supply side) and $MRPL$ (stands for demand side) , and $MRPL$ stands for "Marginal Revenue Product of Labor"

$E_0$ stands for the situation that when the market is in the [[Perfect Competition]] 

And the [[Monopsony]] is to maximize the profit of this single buyer will hire $L$ until *marginal revenue* of hiring the last unit of $L=MC$  of hiring the last unit of $L$ 

The $MR$ of hiring the last unit of $L$ would be $MRP_L=P\frac{\delta F}{\delta L}$ (recall )

However, the $MC$ of hiring the last unit of $L$ may not be $w$ (the wage rate of the $L$)  See this [[Why the MC of hiring the last unit of L may not be w]]
