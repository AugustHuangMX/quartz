We can divide the word "[[Monopsony]]" by "Mono" and "psony"  which means Single Buyer.

The basic graph of it could be this, which consists of $w^s$ (stands for supply side) and $MRP_L$ (stands for demand side) , and $MRP_L$ stands for "Marginal Revenue Product of Labor"

$E_0$ stands for the situation that when the market is in the [[Perfect Competition]] 

And the [[Monopsony]] is to maximize the profit of this single buyer will hire $L$ until *marginal revenue* of hiring the last unit of $L=MC$  of hiring the last unit of $L$ 

The $MR$ of hiring the last unit of $L$ would be $MRP_L=P\frac{\delta F}{\delta L}$ (recall )

However, the $MC$ of hiring the last unit of $L$ may not be $w$ (the wage rate of the $L$)  See this [[Why the MC of hiring the last unit of L may not be w]] 

And the difference value between $w_3$ to $w_p$ is called the *monopsonistic exploitatin*

### Key point: finding the equilibrium value

So how to find the equilibrium value under the [[Monopsony]] situation? So first, you need to find the $MC_L$ curve.

$$
MC_L=\frac{\delta TC}{\delta L}
$$
And the **most important thing** is that you need to find the *equilibrium point* in the $w_s$ curve, since the [[Monopsony]] is the buyer, and you need to try your best to minimize  your cost (spending). For further explanation, please see  [[The Mathematical Model of Monopsony]]
