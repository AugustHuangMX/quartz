### 我的想法

由于孙老师给的一个例题（15.8）涉及到的这个，故觉得应该引起重视。

The lemons market, 中文名叫做 *柠檬市场*，比较典型的就是二手车市场

它的局限性是否在于二手市场相同品类的物品价格不变？

If there is a used car market, and full of high quality cars and low quality cars, and of course the *buyers* and *sellers* have a [Asymmetric Information](Asymmetric%20Information.md) relationship, so that consider the buyer do not know whether the car is good or not, so they can only choose to prefer the average price, for example

$$
P_{avg}=(P_{lemon}+P_{peach})/2
$$
Where peach refers to *good cars*, lemon refers to *bad cars* $P$ here means the cost（成本）not the price 

However, the seller knows their car is lemon or peach, so that only if

$$
P_{lemon}<P_{avg}
$$
The deal could happen.

So after repeated games, *the result would be the quality of cars would continuously decrease and the high quality will get out of the market. ( Because the seller don't want to make the deal)*  This procedure is called **market unraveling**
