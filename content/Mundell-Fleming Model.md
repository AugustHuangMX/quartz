### The Background

The background of the [Mundell-Fleming Model](Mundell-Fleming%20Model.md) is under the [The Open Economy](The%20Open%20Economy) situation, which is also highly related to the [IS-LM model](IS-LM%20model). We can use it to analyze various policies. 

In a [Small Open Economy](Small%20Open%20Economy.md) with perfect capital mobility, the **domestic interest rate**(该经济里的利率) ($r$) is decided by the **world interest rate** ($r^{* }$) , that is, $r=r^{* }$ where $r^{* }$ is exogenously fixed.

- Why the $r^{* }$ is exogenously fixed?

Because we are discussing in a [Small Open Economy](Small%20Open%20Economy.md) the $r$ is so small that can't affect the $r^{* }$

If $r<r^{*}$, the [Small Open Economy](Small%20Open%20Economy.md) will experience [[Capital Outflow]]

If $r>r^{*}$, the [Small Open Economy](Small%20Open%20Economy.md) will experience [[Capital Inflow]]

When either one of these 2 cases happen, international capital flows are rapid enough to maintain:  $r=r^{*}$ 

# What about the exchange rate?

In the [Mundell-Fleming Model](Mundell-Fleming%20Model.md), we analyze the problem in 2 situations:

1. The exchange rate is fixed.
2. The exchange rate is floating.

Also we have to focus on  [[The relationship between Mundell-Fleming Model and IS curve]] and [[The relationship between Mundell-Fleming Model and LM curve]]
