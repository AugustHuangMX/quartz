We may consider it as a three level cases of [[The Market for Lemons]] ( two levels). In the table here, we have three types of buyers: those who want to buy *Low, Medium and High* type of insurance. Each has the same proportion.

Since the proportion is the same, so we could easily calculate the *average* $WTA$ to be $\frac{24+12+6}{3}=14$ and the $WTP$ to be $15$, that is, $WTP>WTA$, so the trade could happen in this case!

**HOWEVER**, In this case, since the $WTA$ would be $14$, so only the *low and medium* types are available to buy.

So no *High level* in the market. Now the $WTA$ becomes $\frac{24+12}{2}=18$, so only *Low level* are affordable to buy. 

Continuously, no one could afford. So no insurance are sold.

#### Conclusion:

The [[Insurance Example]] is another similar example of [[The Market for Lemons]]. Both are used to express in *average* and compare the $WTP$ and $WTA$. What's more important is that the *dynamic procedure*, which some (usually better) types of goods leave the market because no buyers afford them, which will change the $WTP$ and $WTA$ again.
