# Chapter 4 Limits

## Section 4.1 Limits of Functions

### 4.1.1 Definition

The definition of [[Cluster Point]]: Let $A \subseteq \mathbb R$, A point $c \in \mathbb R$ is a [[Cluster Point]] of $A$ if  for every $\delta > 0$ there exists one point $x\in A, x \neq c$ such that $|x-c|<\delta$ 

## Section 4.2 Limit Theorem

### 4.2.1 Definition

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb R$ and $f: A \rightarrow \mathbb R$, and let $c\in \mathbb R$ be a cluster point of $A$, We say that $f$ is bounded on a neighborhood of $c$ if there exists a $\delta$ - neighborhood $V_\delta (c)$ of $c$ and a constant $M>0$ such that we have $|f(x)|\leq M$ for all $x \in A \cap V_\delta (c)$

## Section 6.1 The Derivative
### 6.1.5 Caratheodory Theorem

Let $I$ be an interval,



2 $\varphi(c)\neq 0$, and $\varphi(x)$ is continuous at $c$, then exists $V_\delta (c)$ of $c$ such that $\varphi(x)\neq 0$, $\forall x \in V_\delta (c)\cap I$   

## Section 6.2 The mean value Theorem

Mean Value Theorem is one of the most important results in real analysis.

### Section 6.2.3 Rolle's Theorem

Let $f: [a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb R$, then satisfy those conditions:

1. $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$
3. $f(a)=f(b)$
