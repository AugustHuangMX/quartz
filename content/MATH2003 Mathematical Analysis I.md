Q: How to express a set?

A: Enter by listing all elements explicity, or specifying the property that determines all elements.

Example: $\{2,4,6,8,10\}$ , or $\{x\ is\ even\ numbers\ : 0<x\leq10\}$

Finite and Infinite stes

Intuitionally, we count the elements in a set by "one, two, three"

Theoratically, what we are doing?

Answer: We are building a bijection between the set and (maybe part of ) natural number set

Definition:

1. The empty set $\emptyset$ is said to be have 0 element
2. Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$ , the set $S$ is said to have $n$ elements if ? Bijection from the set  $\mathbb{N}_n := \{1,2,3,...,n\}$
3. The set $S$ is said to be finite if either it is empty or it has $n$ elements for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$
4. The set $S$ is said to be infinite if it is not finite. (It is like a text game, but it is strict.)

Uniqueness: If $S$ is a finite set, then the number of elements of $S$ is a unique number in $\mathbb{N}$ 

Thm: If A has $m$ elements, $B$ has $n$ elements, and if $A\cap B =\emptyset$
