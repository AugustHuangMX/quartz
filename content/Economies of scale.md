A measure of scale economies is 

$$
S(q)=\frac{AC(q)}{MC(q)}
$$

- If $S>1$, economies of scale or increasing returns to scale exist. It is equivalent to $AC(q)$ being an decreasing function of $q$

That is, 

$$
AC(q+\Delta q) = \frac{AC(q)q+MC(q)\Delta q}{q+\Delta q}
$$

-  If $S<1$, diseconomies of scale or decreasing returns to scale exist.
-  If $S=1$, We have [[Constant Return to Scale]], which essentially means constant marginal cost without fixed costs, i.e., $C(q)=kq$

The range before point $A$ exists a increasing returns to scale.
