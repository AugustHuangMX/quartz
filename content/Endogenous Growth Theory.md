> Recall the [Solow Model](Solow%20Model.md),  one drawback is that technological progress is assumed endogenous (i.e.) , the value of $g$ is given

That means, $\frac {\Delta E}{E} = g$

So the new model would be 

$$
Y = K ^ \alpha (LE) ^ {1- \alpha}
$$ with
$$
E=k(k=\frac{K}{L})
$$

The ==logic== behind this is when $k$ increases, the economic activities increases, so the society knowledge increases. Which is also called *Learning by doing*

As Standard, $\Delta k=sy-(n+\delta)k$

$\Delta k=sk-(n+\delta)k$

$\Delta k/k=s-(n+\delta)>0$

We know: $y=k=>\Delta y/y=\Delta k/k$

In the individual case, the [Solow Model](Solow%20Model.md) can be $y=k^ \alpha$ and the [Endogenous Growth Theory](Endogenous%20Growth%20Theory.md) model can be $y=k$

That can explain why US can grow at 2% per year for a long time
