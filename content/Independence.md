# Discrete Case

Two random  variables $X$ and $Y$ are said to be *independently distributed* if 

$$
Pr(Y=y|X=x)= Pr(Y=y)
$$

Since the conditional distribution implies that 

$$
Pr(Y=y|X=x)=\frac{Pr(X=x,Y=y)}{Pr(X=x)}
$$

That is 

$$
Pr(X=x,Y=y)=Pr(X=x)Pr(Y=y)
$$

Then the $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

> Notice that all the conditions must satisfy, or the [[Independence]] do not exist.

# Continuous Case

$Y$ is independent of $X$ if
