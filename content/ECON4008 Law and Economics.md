# Tort Law

Definition of tort: Wrongful acts that cause harm or injury.

## Comparison between [[Contract Law]] and [[Tort Law]] 

-  [[Contract Law]]: Situation where someone harms you by *breaking a promise* they had made
- [[Tort Law]]: Situation where someone harms you *without having made any promises*.

## Classic Legal Theory of [[Tort Law]]

The plaintiff must provide 3 basic elements:

1. Harm
2. Causation
3. Breach of duty

### Element 1: Harm

### Accidents between businesses and their own customers: No Liability

#### If customers correctly judge risks,
- Restaurants take efficient precaution
- Customers demand efficient number of meals

#### If customers can only judge average level

- Restaurants take no precaution
- Since customers know this, demand efficient (low) number 

#### If customers can only judge average level

- Restaurants take no precaution


## To sum up the effects of errors and uncertainty

if $e>0$ that means $x > x^ *$ v.v. 


### Under strict liability:

Random errors in setting damages have no effect: $A + \epsilon$ 

Systematic errors in setting damages will skew the injurer's incentives in the same direction: $A + e + \epsilon > 0$  

When under [[Strict Liability]]:

Cost to the injurer is $wx + P(x)(A + e + \epsilon)$ 

Here, $e$ stands for *systematic error* and $\epsilon$ stands for *random error*, $A + e + \epsilon$ are the social cost in an accidents.

So, injurer tries to minimize the cost,

For the F.O.C condition: $w = -P'(x)(A+e+\epsilon)$ v.s. $-P'(x)A$ which is the *marginal social benefit*

$w$ is the *marginal cost of precaution,* $w = -P'(x)(A+e+\epsilon)$ is the *marginal benefit of precaution to the injurer* (notice that it is not for the whole society)

Once you think about expected cost the injurer minimizes 

$$\mathbb E[wx + P(x)(A+e+\epsilon)] = wx + P(x)(A+e)$$


 $w = -P'(x)(A+e)$ v.s. $-P'(x)A$
