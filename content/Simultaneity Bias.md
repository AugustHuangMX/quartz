In [[Econometrics]], we usually run regression that we initially believe that $X \rightarrow Y$, but what if $Y \rightarrow X$ ? That is called [[Simultaneity Bias]].  we could represent $X=f(Y)$


$$
Y = \beta_0+\beta_1 f(Y) +u
$$

Other problems about the [[Endogeneity Issue]]:

- [[Omitted Variable Bias]]
- [[Measurement Error]]
- [[Ordinary Least Squares]] is inconsistent when there is [[Endogeneity Issue]]
