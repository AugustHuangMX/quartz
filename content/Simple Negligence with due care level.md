[[Negligence with a Defense of Contributory Negligence]] 

Simple Negligence with due care level = high

Seller minimizes private cost by selecting care level

Private cost = with low care $10\% \times 100+8 = 18$

Private cost = with high care $14$


If the buyer can tell/assess the risk perfectly

Value > Total cost of consumption ( price + expected harm) buy.

Otherwise, not buy.

What happens if the buyers believe the risk is $10\%$, regardless of the actual care level provided by the restaurant?

--- 

No Liability Case:

When consumers can accurately assess risk sellers know consumers will choose buy or not based on total consumption cost (price +expected harm)

Low $8+10\% \times 100$ (perceived total cost of consumption)

High $14+1\% \times 100 = 15$

Restaurant will choose high level of care to attract more consumers

Efficient

---

When consumers know only the average risk in the market, not the risk from consuming in a particular restaurant.

$$
14+10\% \times 100 = 24
$$

$$
8+10\% \times 100 = 18
$$

No incentive to increase the care. That means every restaurant will choose the low level of care.

Consumers are ignorant
