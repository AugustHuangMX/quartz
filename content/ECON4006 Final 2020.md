1. Discuss the principal-agent problem. (5 points)
2. A firm’s short run revenue function is given by $R = 20e – 0.5e^2$, and its profit function is given by  $\Pi = R – w$, where “$e$” is the level of effort provided by a worker, and “$w$” is the wage rate of the worker. Suppose that the worker’s problem is to choose the level of “$e$” to maximize his benefit function $B = w – 0.1 e – 0.075 e^2$. Compute the optimal level of effort ($e$), wage ($w$), and profit ($\Pi$) if W = 0.25 R. (10 points)
