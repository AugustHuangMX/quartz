## (a)

略

## (b)

Understanding the [[Self-Regarding Preference]],

We could know that:

$(12,10)\succ_{S}(10,10)\sim_{S}(10,12)\sim_{S}(10,0)\succ_{S}(6,6)$  

## (c)

### i.

If $(10,10)\succ_{I} (12,10)$, we could tell that Alice is **Inequity-averse**.

### ii.

If $(6,6)\succ_{W}(10,0)$ we could tell Alice is **Social-welfare maximization preference**, since only it wants to maximize the whole group's utility.

### iii.

If $(6,6)\succ_{C}(10,12)$ be cause Alice doesn't want to be less than Bob.

### iiii.

If $(10,12)\sim_{S}(10,10)$, because Alice is indifferent among these.

# Question 2

## (a)

Under the assumption of the [[Self-Regarding Preference]], Alice would like to let Bob to choose between $(200,100)$ or $(100,100)$, since for Alice, $(200,100)\succ (100,100)\sim (100,0)$. Since for Bob, $(100,100)\sim (200,100)$. So there would be 3  [[Nash Equilibrium]] 

## (b)

Bob's choice of an allocation that is more favorable to Alice can be seen as a reward for trusting or being kind to Alice. Even though Bob acts according to self-interested preferences and chooses (100,100) to make himself more profitable, if he chooses (200,100), this can be interpreted as a reward for his friendly behavior towards Alice, thus revealing positive reciprocity.

## (c)

It is not costly for Bob to choose between $(200,100)$ and $(100,100)$. 

If we could modify a bit, we could give Bob a little cost, for example, let Bob's payoff be $(200,100-x)$, and check whether it exists **Reciprocity**.

## (d)

It may not be the case, since Alice may wait Bob to choose the $(200,100)$ for her. Only when Alice give up the game, should be the other-regarding preference.

## (e)

In order to make Alice's behavior of letting Bob decide in the allocation (100,0) more convincing evidence of others' preferences, we can modify the rules of the game so that Alice takes some risk when Bob decides. For example, if Alice lets Bob decide, we can set an option such that Bob can choose an allocation that is favorable to him and unfavorable to Alice, such as (150,150), so that Alice's potential gain drops to 0. In this case, if Alice still chooses to let Bob decide, then her behavior demonstrates that she is willing to risk her personal loss in anticipation of Bob's reciprocal behavior , which would be strong evidence that she is demonstrating trust in Bob and embodying the preferences of others.

## (f)

The modified game can be used to investigate whether Bob's preferences are more influenced by unfairness aversion or desire for reward. If Bob chooses an allocation that is unfavorable to Alice, when faced with a situation in which Alice takes a risk and lets him decide, this may indicate that his behavior is influenced by unfairness aversion - he would prefer that neither party benefit rather than accept an unfair outcome. If Bob chooses a balanced distribution, even if it means a reduction in his personal gain, this may indicate a strong desire to reciprocate Alice's trust and risk.
