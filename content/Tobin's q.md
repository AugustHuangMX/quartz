**托賓q理論**（英語：Tobin's q theory）為美國經濟學家[詹姆士·托賓](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A9%B9%E5%A7%86%E5%A3%AB%C2%B7%E6%89%98%E8%B3%93 "詹姆士·托賓")於1969年提出的投資理論，而**托賓q比率**（英語：Tobin's q）是以企業的股票市場價值和企業的帳面淨值之間的比較。

## 公式


$q=\frac{Market\ Value\ of\ Capital}{Replacement\ Cost\ of\ Capital}$

> The denominator is the price of that capital if it were purchased today.

*Example*: ABC company has $40 million assets. One million stocks are issued and the price of them is $3 per stock. Tobin's q?

$=\frac{1\ million * \$ 3}{40\ million}=0.75<1$

If Tobin's q > 1,
Managers should buy more capital

If Tobin's q < 1,

Managers should stop buying more capital. They should not replace old capital

It seems that the Tobin's q theory is unlike the old ones like [[Consumption according to Keynes]], but they have close relationship, recall that Tobin's q depends on *Current and future expected profits from capital*
So when $MPK$ exceeds the cost of capital, so it earns the profit （边际产量大于边际成本）, vice versa.

==The decision of investment is not only depended by the current policy, but also the expected future. ==
