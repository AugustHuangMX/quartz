Difference in Difference: Naturally, we use the randomised control trial (RCT) to analyze questions in natural science, but it is impractical for [[Minimum Wage]].

### Standard view:

- Minimum Wage reduces employment



Consider the market for low-wage labour, with the $W^{*}$ as the equilibrium wage. if we bind the *minimum wage* at wage $W^{min}>W^{*}$, what will happen is the labour demand would decreases to  $L^{min}$. However, the labours would consider the higher wage, so the supply is also getting higher in this case, creating the labour supply $L^{'}$, so the unemployment goes up to $L^{'}- L^{min}$

*Question 5.1: How would the introduction of a minimum wage affect the employment and wages of skilled (= high wage) workers? What about workers in an informal sector where the minimum wage doesn’t apply?*

Answer: within the framework of the standard model, effect on employment is ambiguous, combination of 

- Substitution Effect
- Scale Effect

And the effect on wages depends on the employment effect.

*Question 5.2: According to the Hicks-Marshall law of derived demand, which four factors affect the employment response to a minimum wage increase?*

The size of the reduction depends on **substitution** and **scale** effects. 

	The papers discuss last week generally focus on a particular city/industry.

Empirical studies show little negative employment effects, Which, in this environment, means demand for low-wage labour is inelastic

- Elasticity of factor substitution (substitution effect)

Firms can’t easily substitute other factors for low-wage labour (eg fixed technology, regulations)

Putty-clay model

- Elasticity of supply of other factors (substitution effect)

Supply of capital is inelastic, making it costly to substitute

- Price elasticity of (product) demand (scale effect)

Product demand is inelastic; higher factor prices can be passed on as higher product prices

- Factor share in total costs (scale effect)

Low-wage labour is a small share of total costs; cost/ price increases are small

The drawback of the large amount of papers in the empirical papers are they only focus on the *short-time effect*


Competitive market for low-wage labour:

Law of one price, i.e. single, market-clearing wage rate

Wage dispersion

- Different worker-types (LOP ([[Law of One Price]]) still holds for same type?)
- Or imperfect/ monopsonistic competition in the labour market

*Why some of the biggest beneficiaries are in the middle of the income distribution?*

Because the MW law might not well-targeted on the poorest households.
