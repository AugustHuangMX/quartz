The example case is in the *Hammonds v. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co.*

There are $\$100$ of gas, and two companies are competing for maximize their utility, where they could choose whether to drill fast or slow.

While *slow* costs $\$5$, and  *fast* costs $\$25$. If they are on the same speed, they share their outcome.

Here, if we use the way that is [[First Possession]], the situation would become this:

The [[Nash Equilibrium]] here would be $(25,25)$, of course it is not the *efficient case*. (Create the incentive to invest too much *too early* in order to establish (overproduce problem))

Otherwise we use the [[Tied Ownership]] method, the [[Tied Ownership]] method encourage efficient exploration and extraction.

In this case, no matter of the speed, each firm would get the same outcome ($\$50$), in this case, in order to avoid earning less, both firms would choose to drill slowly.
