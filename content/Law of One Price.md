The Law of One Price (LOP) asserts that in an efficient market, all identical goods must have **only** one price. Essentially, the price for the same commodity should be the same when there are no transportation costs and no differential taxes applied between two different markets. It is a concept used to describe the expected uniformity of prices across different markets, assuming free flow of goods, no trade barriers, and no costs of moving goods between markets.
